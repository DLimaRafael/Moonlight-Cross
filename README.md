## FAQ on Code Structure
More will be added to this as I go updating the code and implementing new wacky elements that need to be explained in further detail.

1. ### Why are you putting classes on the same file?
Simple, for now, I don't see the benefit of creating multiple files for each class, when it comes to the spells and items, it's something that'll most likely need
to be parsed from a separate text file later on, if it doesn't impact code readability, then I'm fine with it.

2. ### Any dates? Timelines etc.?
Not really, this is something I want to do as a means to study for my OOP classes, I can't guarantee a good, polished and finished project and can't guarantee any dates whatsoever.
